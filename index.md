Hi! I'm Darby and I'm a fourth-year PhD student in linguistics at the University of Southern California.


My reserach interests are primarily in phonology, morphology, and experimental/lab phonology. I'm advised by [Stephanie Shih](https://stephsus.github.io/) and [Louis Goldstein](https://sail.usc.edu/~lgoldste/me/), and I'm especially interested in affixation, particularly the asymmetry between prefixes and suffixes, both typologically, and in the exceptional phonological behavior of prefixes. I'm also very interested in the relationship between the phonological grammar and the lexicon, and much of my research is focused on how phonological and lexical representations must look for morphologically complex and/or exceptional forms.  


I'm originally from Michigan, and received a BA and MA from Michigan State University. For my MA, I studied phonotactic acceptability judgments using methods from speech perception and was advised by [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io/).
