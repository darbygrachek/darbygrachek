I'm originally from Michigan, and recieved a BA and MA from Michigan State University. For my MA, I studied phonotactic acceptability judgments using methods from speech perception and was advised by [Dr. Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io/). 

My reserach interests are primarily in phonetics and phonology. I'm especially interested in phonotactic acceptability judgments and how they can be used to better understand whether the phonological grammar is gradient or categorical. I'm also interested in the characteristics that separate stress and tone languages, and those that are in-between (pitch accent languages).
