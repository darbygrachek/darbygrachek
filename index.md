# About me


Hi! I'm Darby and I'm a third-year PhD student in linguistics at the University of Southern California.

My reserach interests are primarily in phonology, phonetics, and experimental/lab phonology. I'm advised by [Louis Goldstein](https://sail.usc.edu/~lgoldste/me/) and [Stephanie Shih](https://stephsus.github.io/), and I'm especially interested in prosodic systems and what leads to exceptions in regular prosodic patterns. I'm also interested in affixation, particularly the asymmetry between prefixes and suffixes, both typologically, and in the exceptional phonological behavior of prefixes.


I'm originally from Michigan, and received a BA and MA from Michigan State University. For my MA, I studied phonotactic acceptability judgments using methods from speech perception and was advised by [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io/).
