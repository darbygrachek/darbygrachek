# Darby Grachek


Hi! I'm Darby and I'm a second-year PhD student in linguistics at the University of Southern California.

I'm originally from Michigan, and recieved a BA and MA from Michigan State University. For my MA, I studied phonotactic acceptability judgments using methods from speech perception and was advised by [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io/). 

My reserach interests are primarily in phonology, phonetics, and experimental/lab phonology. I'm advised by [Louis Goldein](https://sail.usc.edu/~lgoldste/me/) and [Stephanie Shih](https://stephsus.github.io/), and I'm especially interested in prosodic systems and what leads to exceptions in regular prosodic patterns. I'm also interested in phonotactic acceptability judgments and how they can be used to better understand whether the phonological grammar is gradient or categorical.
